# Heart Disease Prediction

This project is part of the [Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/) course. It involves building a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health metrics.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
- **Features**: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, etc.

## 🧠 Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
- **Modeling**: Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest classifiers.
- **Evaluation**: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score to assess model performance.

## 📈 Results

- **Best Model**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy**: 85%
- **ROC-AUC Score**: 0.88

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
- Explore advanced models like Gradient Boosting Machines.
- Deploy the model using a web framework for real-time predictions.
