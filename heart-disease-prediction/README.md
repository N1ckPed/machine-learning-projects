# End-to-End Heart Disease Classification

This project is based on a practical mini-project from the [Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/) course. It walks through a full machine learning workflow to predict heart disease based on patient health data.
